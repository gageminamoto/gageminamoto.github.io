Hey, it's Gage, Graphic Designer & Portrait photographer based in Honolulu, Hawaii. I first picked up a camera four years ago and haven't looked back since. I've always wanted his work to give viewers a glimpse into a subject's world. While standing out in today’s landscape isn't easy, I aim to create work that my clients and I can be proud of.

When I'm not out with a client, I'm out at the skatepark, at the beach, designing at work, or out with friends. I'm is currently studying Management Information Systems at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.
