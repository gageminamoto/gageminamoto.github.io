<p>I must say while I was hesitant about WODs at first, I really appreciate the asynchronous elements it has. In this way I could make sure with each WOD I could take my time, while still being focused as I was trying to hit a goal in the back of my head. Luckily for me, while writing my own code from scratch is new territory, my current job has me learning how to read and edit HTML/CSS. So the reading HTML has been mostly smooth. However, I constantly will forget what element or tag I’ll need to perform the action I need. So W3 School has be so valuable in getting quick refreshers on HTML syntax.</p>

<h1>First WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</il>
  <li>2nd attempt: ~18 minutes - Av</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: ~16 minutes - Av</li>
  <li>4th attempt: ~14 minutes - Rx</li>
  <li>5th attempt: ~15 minutes - Av</li>
</ul>

<p>This is why my first WOD took a total of 6 tries. Most of the try were me figuring out how to run a node server. After several attempts of troubleshooting, I globally installed several modules to fix the issues.  From then on it wasn’t long before I was getting the hang of quickly writing lines of code. Because of my several attempts I eventually got tries that I was happy with. My first 2 WODS were Rx’s now that I was getting the hang of HTML and screen recording. While I continued to have frustrating issues with formatting the columns, I eventually learned that inspect element was my best friend! Now I feel like I’ve gotten a rhythm and as time progress, my general skills of WODs will continue to grow.</p>

<p>My advice is to take advantage of every resource provided to you; like is in the real world. For me when I learning anything for the first time there rarely is something I can just rip off and call it day. On the job there’s gonna be specific structures or feature your just gonna have to make yourself. But again, worker smarter not harder. The are countless help on Github, Reddit, Youtube, etc. What initially intrigued me about coding was the open source nature of the field. Yet only the best coders know how to use the tools to assist them, and not just copy.</p>

<p>I also always suggest doing your a brief run through of the reading getting the general idea. Because realistically no one is expecting to memorize everything this early on. These things get done by not just memorizing. With that being said, when doing WODS I suggest recording your first attempt because you might surprise yourself and get a passing grade.</p>
