<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I must say while I was hesitant about WODs at first, I really appreciate the asynchronous elements it has. In this way I could make sure with each WOD I could take my time, while still being focused as I was trying to hit a goal in the back of my head. Luckily for me, while writing my own code from scratch is new territory, my current job has me learning how to read and edit HTML/CSS. So the reading HTML has been mostly smooth. However, I constantly will forget what element or tag I’ll need to perform the action I need. So W3 School has be so valuable in getting quick refreshers on HTML syntax.</p>

<h1>First WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</il>
  <li>2nd attempt: ~20 minutes - DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>4th attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>5th attempt: ~5 minutes - DNF</li>
  <li>6th attempt: ~15 minutes - Av</li>
</ul>

<p>My first WOD took a total of six tries. Most of the try were me figuring out how to run a node server. After several attempts of troubleshooting, I globally installed several modules to fix the issues.  From then on it wasn’t long before I was getting the hang of quickly writing lines of code. Because of my several attempts I eventually got tries that I was happy with. My first two WODS were Rx’s now that I was getting the hang of HTML and screen recording. While I continued to have frustrating issues with formatting the columns, I eventually learned that inspect element was my best friend! Now I feel like I’ve gotten a rhythm and as time progress, my general skills of WODs will continue to grow.</p>

<h1>Second WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>2nd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: ~11 minutes - Av</li>
  <li>4th attempt: ~8 minutes - Rx</li>
</ul>

<p>After getting the hang of the screen recording, I felt comfortable DNF'ing on my attempts. So I used two attempts to play out, limit the CSS, and try out variables without the screencast. Eventually, I got stuck getting the webpage to look exact, so I watched up the part I needed to troubleshoot. I finished the webpage on my third attempt but forgot to include a few things after I had already recorded the cast. Finally, on the last attempt, I learned that splitting the HTML file and the style sheet within the window would be easier. This sped up the process significantly, and the simple CSS syntax made this final attempt a breeze.</p>

<h1>Third WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>2nd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: ~19 minutes - Sd</li>
  <li>4th attempt: ~13 minutes - Rx</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm exhausted from the prior two WODs, so I took a break. On the third WOD, I assume the short task list meant this would be the easiest one yet. But this WOD took me the longest, and I found solving the bugs I was experiencing challenging. For example, the nature of the multiple columns made it naturally unintuitive and required some out-of-the-box solutions to solve. In addition, separate columns had other classes and properties associated with each. I eventually had to watch the screencast as I had trouble getting all the padding to align horizontally. Also, this was the first WOD where I employed the inspect element to debug the page while doing the WOD.</p>

<h1>Advice</h1>

<p>My advice is to take advantage of every resource provided to you; like is in the real world. For me when I learning anything for the first time there rarely is something I can just rip off and call it day. On the job there’s gonna be specific structures or feature your just gonna have to make yourself. But again, worker smarter not harder. The are countless help on Github, Reddit, Youtube, etc. What initially intrigued me about coding was the open source nature of the field. Yet only the best coders know how to use the tools to assist them, and not just copy. I also always suggest doing your a brief run through of the reading getting the general idea. Because realistically no one is expecting to memorize everything this early on. These things get done by not just memorizing. With that being said, when doing WODS I suggest recording your first attempt because you might surprise yourself and get a passing grade. I also suggest double checking everything is complete before stopping the screen recording. There were several attempts I lost due to being careless early into the WOD.</p>
