<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The first WODs I did for ITM325 were BrowserHistory 1, 2, and 3. The core of the goal was to create a webpage summarizing the Browsers' history. Students were asked to use HTML and CSS to format the page correctly. The first WOD was to make the site's skeleton with basic element tags and images. This layout would be fundamental to the rest of the WODs. The second WOD had students create and link a stylesheet and develop definitions for a webpage using CSS. The third WOD asks for three columns to hold the three browsers and nav bar in the header. I took six attempts to the first WOD to learn screen recording. For WODs two and three, it took me four attempts and plenty of minutes due to trial and error.</p>

<h1>First WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</il>
  <li>2nd attempt: ~20 minutes - DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>4th attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>5th attempt: ~5 minutes - DNF</li>
  <li>6th attempt: ~15 minutes - Av</li>
</ul>

<p>I advise taking advantage of every resource you provide, like in the real world. For me, when I learn anything for the first time, there rarely is something I can rip off and call it a day. On the job, there are going to be specific structures or features you are just going to have to make yourself. But again, work smarter, not harder. The are countless help on Github, Reddit, Youtube, etc. What initially intrigued me about coding was the open-source nature of the field. Yet only the best coders know how to use the tools to assist them, not just copy. I also suggest doing a brief run-through of the reading to get a general idea. Because realistically, no one is expecting to memorize everything this early on. These things get done by not just memorizing. When doing WODS, I suggest recording your first attempt because you might surprise yourself and get a passing grade. I also recommend double-checking that everything is complete before stopping the screen recording. I lost several attempts due to being careless early into the WOD.</p>

<h1>Second WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>2nd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: ~11 minutes - Av</li>
  <li>4th attempt: ~8 minutes - Rx</li>
</ul>

<p>After getting the hang of the screen recording, I felt comfortable DNF'ing on my attempts. So I used two attempts to play out, limit the CSS, and try out variables without the screencast. Eventually, I got stuck getting the webpage to look exact, so I watched up the part I needed to troubleshoot. I finished the webpage on my third attempt but forgot to include a few things after I had already recorded the cast. Finally, on the last attempt, I learned that splitting the HTML file and the style sheet within the window would be easier. This sped up the process significantly, and the simple CSS syntax made this final attempt a breeze.</p>

<h1>Third WOD</h1>
<ul>
  <li>1st attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>2nd attempt: DNF</li>
  <li>3rd attempt: ~19 minutes - Sd</li>
  <li>4th attempt: ~13 minutes - Rx</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm exhausted from the prior two WODs, so I took a break. On the third WOD, I assume the short task list meant this would be the easiest one yet. But this WOD took me the longest, and I found solving the bugs I was experiencing challenging. For example, the nature of the multiple columns made it naturally unintuitive and required some out-of-the-box solutions to solve. In addition, separate columns had other classes and properties associated with each. I eventually had to watch the screencast as I had trouble getting all the padding to align horizontally. Also, this was the first WOD where I employed the inspect element to debug the page while doing the WOD.</p>
