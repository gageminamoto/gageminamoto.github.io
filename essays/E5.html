  <!-- By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, write a technical essay (blog) that summarizes your experiences reflecting on your experience in preparing for, and implementing and what you learned from Assignment 2. If you did a peer evaluation you may repeat some of your responses here.

When providing answers to the following items, be as specific as possible. Avoid vague answers like “I learned a lot” and “My partner did all the work”. However, be as concise as possible. Copy this this of questions and put your responses below them: -->
<ol>
  <!-- Question 1 -->
  <li><B>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</B></li>
  <p>Assignment 2 has students adding onto Assignment 1's e-Commerce Website with fundamental features like login &
    register pages, personalization per user, and the beginnings of security.</p>

  <BR>
  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <li><b>What did you learn from this assignment?</b></li>
  <p>I learned just how complex passing query string can be and how I dug deep into how to post and get request work individually and together. With cookies and sessions, it took a lot of work to implement persistent user data. I also learned the value of time management and remaining organized in the planning process.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 3 -->
  <li><b>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the
      assignment (including yourself).</b></li>
  <p>I worked on the project by myself with occasional office hours with Professor Kazman. While having others to work with is beneficial and necessary in the real world, it was nice to be self-reliant and go through the learning process alone. In the future, I want to work with a partner to learn how pushing code and dividing tickets among a team is.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 4 -->
  <li><b>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</b></li>
  <p>Whenever I needed help, I would go to office hours to get some basic advice on the logic of programming features. Then, I would struggle with syntax and debugging on my own. This meant it was challenging to finish every single feature, but I did the best I could with the time allotted and my limited coding experience.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 5 -->
  <li><b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</b></li>
  <p>This assignment was much more work on the server, figuring out how to debug the passing of query string, doing a lot of personal research, and brushing up on how node js as a language works. Wrapping my head around the utility of node was what I struggled with in the beginning.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 6 -->
  <li><b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b></li>
  <p>15% thinking, 30% writing code, and 55% testing and debugging. Overall I spent the least amount of time thinking about how I was going to code a feature. For the most part, once I researched examples of login pages, it was mostly writing the code and then struggling as to why my first code wasn't working logically.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 7 -->
  <li><b>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</b></li>
  <p>I did a good job scheduling time to work on the project. Also, when I had momentum, I rode it and worked on the assignment longer than intended. This, however, took a lot of time out of my day and mentally exhausted me. I want to implement the agile methodology, a common method used by software developers.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 8 -->
  <li><b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</b></li>
  <p>I hope to finish all the features assigned, so I wish I had planned goals for the features I wanted to be finished. I then would have done my best to complete them by the deadlines. While I don't regret working alone, I wish I would've at least considered having a partner. I could have completed more of the assignment and gotten a better grade.</p>
