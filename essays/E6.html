  <!-- By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page (due no more than 1 day after submitting the assignment to your Assignment 3 on Laulima), write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences reflecting on your experience in preparing for, and implementing and what you learned from Assignment 3.

When providing answers to the following items, be as specific as possible. Avoid vague answers like “I learned a lot” and “My partner did all the work”. However, be as concise as possible. Copy this list of questions and put your responses below them:-->
<ol>
  <!-- Question 1 -->
  <li><b>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</b></li>
  <p>Gage's Running Shoe Store was recently established and entirely online, creating a wide range of silhouettes to fit
    your running form. On launch, the store sells three brands of shoes; Nike, Adidas, and Asics. Not only are these
    well-rated brands among runners, but all shoes have been tested and recommended by the owner.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <li><b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</b></li>
  <p>I could not add to cards to display how the items in your cart, and the invoice page don't calculate taxes and totals. Instead acts like a receipt.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 3 -->
  <li><b>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</b></li>
  <p>Thanks to my use of the bootstrap framework, I like how my website's UI looks. My UI is minimal, and I use welcoming blues to invite users to use my site. Specifically the item products I designed myself, and I'm thrilled with how they turned out.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 4 -->
  <li><b>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</b></li>
  <p>I'm unhappy with how my invoice page turned out as it doesn't calculate tax and shipping and, overall, look lackluster. It was the best I could do as I struggled with figuring out how to allow prior assignments invoice tables to read the three key object structures.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 5 -->
  <li><b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</b></li>
  <p>The three brands of products made this assignment difficult for me as I affected all aspects of the website and broke functionality in many areas.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 6 -->
  <li><b>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</b></li>
  <p>When running into a problem, I would look up the issue and read several articles to see if others had a similar issue. If not, I looked at sites like W3 schools to relearn how a particular part of my code functions. Then I'd get to debugging by console. logging in a strategic place to pinpoint the issue.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 7 -->
  <li><b>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment.</b></li>
  <p>I made the mistake of underestimating the amount of work required for the project last time, so this time I want to be more organized and plan to avoid repeating the same mistake. I understood exactly what needed to be done and set clear goals to ensure I completed the project on time.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 8 -->
  <li><b>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment.</b></li>
  <p>For most of assignment 3 I failed to parse cookies as I had forgotten to add the node module. I'm glad I preserved and managed to debug my cookie. Although I may have struggled initially, I'm content knowing that I've learned plenty, no matter what grade I get. I furthered my knowledge of sessions and cookies and their utility in this particular iteration.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 9 -->
  <li><b>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</b></li>
  <p>I learned to have discipline when having time to work on the project but not feeling up to it. Despite my feeling, I had to push through and make progress on the project.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 10 -->
  <li><b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</b></li>
  <p>I would've liked to work with group mates as to share much of the workloads and responsibilities. Although there are obvious challenges that come with group work, I think the increase in morale and motivation would've been worth it.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 11 -->
  <li><b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b></li>
  <p>(a )30% thinking about how to do something, (b) 20% writing code (not including testing), (c) 50% testing and debugging</p>
  <BR>
  <p>This time, I spent much more time figuring out how to implement something logically before I'd actually code. Despite this feeling odd at first, it saved me lots of time and gave me a better direction when coding new features or reworking old ones.</p>
  <BR>
  <!-- Question 12 -->
  <li><b>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization")</b></li>
  <p>Gage Minamoto - 100% of the project</p>
  <BR>
