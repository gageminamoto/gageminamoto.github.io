While I realize a specific degree in Graphic Design would prove helpful, I foresee myself doing more than just graphic designing. However, in my outlook on the job market in the future, I think it is very likely that a significant portion of the job market will be remote. The general nine to five will not be the only dominating template for workers. Because of this, I believe being well-rounded in various skills for internet content creation will almost become a must. For example, besides graphic design, one might also need to know the basics of UX design, photography, social analytics, etc. Whether you work for a company, the being will learn new skills and value them over some specialists.

The Shidler's Management Information Systems Degree or MIS is a common and recommended degree for product design. While the degree is often general in its material, covering many aspects of information technologies (IT), it can be used as a launching platform in UX design. Moreover, if I pivot my career path, the degree can be used in a variety of business firms as one of every kind utilizing IT. Many firms will not only continue to further their operations with IT but expand their systems to meet the demand for new technologies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, MIS-related careers are forecasted to have increased job growth in the upcoming years. MIS has recently become popular as likely major stems from the ever-expanding career in MIS. Careers can span from project management to system architecture and design.

After speaking with my business advisor, I learned that the MIS pathway is straightforward and leaves plenty of credits open to electives of my choosing. Luckily this means I have the option to minor in art or take additional classes related to design and coding. Learning these benefits made MIS an easy choice and my main major here at UH.
