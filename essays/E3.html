By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences reflecting on your experience in preparing for and your resulting performance on the last WOD.

** NOTE ** Do this blog AFTER you have done the last WOD

Do not include the source code in your essay. Instead, address the following:

1.Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details

2.Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.

3.Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?

4.Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

  <p>Invoice 1 is the first new assignment type for creating a sales receipt. It asks the students to create a table listing 5 items, quantities, and prices. Students must also write HTML and Javascript to find the total by calculating subtotal and tax. All of the computing must be done dynamically and organized by comments.</p>

  <p>On my first attempt, I struggled with how to limit the decimal calculations and place variables within a string. But after a few minutes of research, I learned ${} allowed me to nest a variable inside a string. .toFixed(2) method rounds the string in two decimals. Moreover, I was initially confused on how to compute extended price as I had never refered to that quantity as such. I also just learned of the requirment of voiceovering all the WODs. I plan to do redo the recording to but this time me saying my thoughts while I do it.</p>

  <p>I’ve learned what works best for me is making the first attempt at the WOD until I fail to struggle and better learn the material being taught. Once I’ve fully completed the first attempt and satisfied with the time, I restart, hoping to complete the next time with an Rx score; this WOD was no different. It helped to quickly do a run-through of the code to refresh my memory on the correct code. Its also a good idea to have your first attempt saved in a folder just in case I struggle to remember how to do the exercise.</p>

  <p>For next time I’d like to attempt to write a version of the WOD without the instructions and create the updates just by the mockup provided. Likely, I won’t get far, but I think getting into the mindset of starting from scratch is good practice. I’ll also make sure to narrate my mistakes better, trying to run through the issues I run into out loud. It may be helpful to look back on the errors with commentary.</p>
