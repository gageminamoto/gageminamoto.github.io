<!-- 
By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences reflecting on your experience in preparing for and your resulting performance on the last WOD.

** NOTE ** Do this blog AFTER you have done the last WOD

Do not include the source code in your essay. Instead, address the following:

1.Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details

2.Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.

3.Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?

4.Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

<h1>Browser History 6</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>First Attempt ~ 48 min - DNF</li>
    <li>Second Attempt ~ 22 min - Av</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href = "http://github.com/gageminamoto/ITM352_F2022/tree/main/WODs/BrowserHistory6">Link to Browser History 6 Repo</a></p>

  <p>Browser History 6 has students creating a dynamic website with four separate pages. One homepage and a page for 3 of the web browsers. There are also slight visual changes in the CSS.</p>
  <p>At first, I had trouble making the onclick button set the window location. It required a lot of tweaking and testing off-camera. I eventually figured out where to put the onclick="window.location.href = 'firefox.html'”. I also suggest looking at the hints before starting the WOD as it can take up precious time evening reading them.</p>
  <p>To prepare for this WOD, I reviewed Browser History 6 and caught myself up with what I had done prior. Like usual, I did one test run where I expected DNF to make sure the code I’m doing works properly, giving me time to test the code. Sometimes I can even get curious about the code, and I’ll make adjustments unrelated to the WOD just to test theories.</p>
  <p>Next time I defiantly want to be organized in my task and avoid skipping around the steps. It takes time to figure out what I’ve done and need to do still. </p>

<h1>SmartPhoneProducts with Variables</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>First Attempt ~ 35 min - DNF</li>
    <li>Second Attempt ~ 15 min - Av</li>
    <li>Third Attempt ~ 6 min - Rx</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This WOD asks students to create and utilize variables to prevent hard coding. This is essential for a product list as code can adjust to product change and not the other way around. In the end, the display page should look the same. </p>
  <p>On my initial attempt, I had trouble figuring out how to replace the h2, p, and img elements with the new code. After some quick investigation, I discovered that how to use the find option to replace these elements with the new line of code.</p>
  <p>I've discovered that what works best for me is doing the WOD for the first time until I fail. This WOD was no different; after finishing the first try ultimately and being happy with the time, I restarted with the hopes of finishing the second and third time with an Rx score.</p>
  <p>Next time I wish to take my time comprehending the code instead of bashing my head trying to figure out what the instructions are asking. I will read the prompts first and try to envision the steps it will take to complete them. </p>

<h1>Invoice 1</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>First Attempt ~ 48 min - DNF</li>
    <li>Second Attempt ~ 21 min - Av</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href = "https://github.com/gageminamoto/ITM352_F2022/blob/main/WODs/Invoice1/invoice.html">Link to Invoice 1 Repo</a></p>

  <p>Invoice 1 is the first new assignment type for creating a sales receipt. It asks the students to create a table listing 5 items, quantities, and prices. Students must also write HTML and Javascript to find the total by calculating subtotal and tax. All of the computing must be done dynamically and organized by comments.</p>

  <p>On my first attempt, I struggled with how to limit the decimal calculations and place variables within a string. But after a few minutes of research, I learned ${} allowed me to nest a variable inside a string. .toFixed(2) method rounds the string in two decimals. Moreover, I was initially confused on how to compute extended price as I had never refered to that quantity as such. I also just learned of the requirment of voiceovering all the WODs. I plan to do redo the recording to but this time me saying my thoughts while I do it.</p>

  <p>I’ve learned what works best for me is making the first attempt at the WOD until I fail to struggle and better learn the material being taught. Once I’ve fully completed the first attempt and satisfied with the time, I restart, hoping to complete the next time with an Rx score; this WOD was no different. It helped to quickly do a run-through of the code to refresh my memory on the correct code. Its also a good idea to have your first attempt saved in a folder just in case I struggle to remember how to do the exercise.</p>

  <p>For next time I’d like to attempt to write a version of the WOD without the instructions and create the updates just by the mockup provided. Likely, I won’t get far, but I think getting into the mindset of starting from scratch is good practice. I’ll also make sure to narrate my mistakes better, trying to run through the issues I run into out loud. It may be helpful to look back on the errors with commentary.</p>

<h1>Invoice 2</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>First Attempt ~ 35 min - DNF</li>
    <li>Second Attempt ~ 8 min - Av</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href = "https://github.com/gageminamoto/ITM352_F2022/tree/main/WODs/SmartPhoneProducts variables">Link to Invoice 2 Repo</a></p>

  <p>This WOD as students to use the expression to generate a sales receipt without any hard code. IT will utilize the work we did in Invoice 1.</p>
  <p>This WOD was nice because it had a quality checklist, ensuring all aspects of the WOD were completed. It made it easy to go down a list and limit testing the code. I’ve continued my routine of starting the WOD expecting DNF and then trying to better explain the code on 2nd attempt. </p>
  <p>To prepare for this WOD, I again reviewed the prior WOD to understand how the code worked. </p>
  <p>I want to take my time deciphering the code rather than scrambling to understand the syntax. I'll read w3school beforehand and try to remember most of the syntactical template.</p>

<h1>SmartPhoneProducts 2</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>First Attempt ~ 48 min - DNF</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href = "https://github.com/gageminamoto/ITM352_F2022/blob/main/WODs/SmartPhoneProducts2/products_display.html">Link to SmartPhoneProducts 2 Repo</a></p>

  <p>This WOD aimed to use our newfound knowledge of loops to generate an HTML table with smartphone products. It would create the product display from the data rather than hard code each section</p>
  <p>Adding the variable to the products_display.html was a breeze, but I was initially slowed down by implementing the templates. Eventually, looking at W3 schools and a few refresher youtube videos caught me up. I also initially forgot to delete the original 5 <sections>, the ones not in the string template. The for-loop to the longest to figure out, but I generally modeled it after prior ex we had done in the lab. </p>
  <p>I reviewed the last WOD once more to ensure I knew how the coding operated before starting this WOD. </p>
  <p>I hope to write the essay portion immediately after completing the WOD to prevent me from miscalling how I performed during the WOD. Also, making my voiceover more in-depth would help. </p>
