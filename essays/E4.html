  <!-- technical essay (blog entry) reflecting on your experience in developing basic JAVASCRIPT programs. -->
  <ol>
    <li><B>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</B></li>
    <p>I feel confident in my ability to learn new concepts in Javascript. While I’m still working on my ability to write code solutions to problems, I, for the most part, can start the basic skeleton. For example, I can currently comment on a web page's general outline and know what I need from my code. I’ve also gotten quite sufficient at DOM. While I’ve still got a long way to go, I’ve realized my debugging skills have slowly improved. It’s become simple for me to find syntax errors, like missing brackets. Still things bugs related logic are still prove difficult, but I believe they’ll improve with time and practice. </p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</b></li>
    <p>I need to develop my overall knowledge of Javascript syntax, as I often need clarification about when to use what. Things like forEach loops I understand their purpose but implementing myself without a reference can be on the slower side. Also, the recent introduction of making our servers with express has been difficult. This is most difficult as I must keep track of code on two separate files and ensure they both work. The post method has been quite difficult</p>
    <p>I also want to improve my ability to explain in sudeo code or plain English what a block of code is doing. Right now, I can fumble my way through an explanation. I want to get into the habit of commenting on my code as it's helpful for me in comprehension and good practice when others look at it.</p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</b></li>
    <p>WODs are a helpful tool in my learning the javascript concepts quickly. Because the pace of the class is so quick, WODs are a great way to implement what I just learned. And it points out where I’m struggling.</p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</b></li>
    <p>The labs have been a great hands-on learning experience, but trying to answer the lab's questions can be difficult while also trying to keep up. And the issue with answering the question after the class is questions will ask about particular parts.</p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</b></li>
    <p>Going into assignment 1, I thought I wasn’t expecting to learn so much so quickly. Implementing all the skill we’ve been taught proved more challenging that I could’ve imagined. Creating the Javascript validation on the server took several hours to rap my head around and solve. But through persistence I managed to solve the lab. Unfortunately, this left me little time to work on the individual requirement so I had to do mines last minute. But, through a few office hours and lots of debugging, I was able to create the function! </p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</b></li>
    <p>Record WODs with voiceovers has become a whole ordeal in my studying, and it's become quite inconvenient to do them. I don’t find it beneficial to do a voiceover, and it tends to distract me from focusing on purposeful code. The recording becomes more of a performance than my actual coding performance. I’d much rather avoid the recording and use comments to explain the code.</p>
    <BR>
    <li><b>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</b></li>
    <p>Screencasts helped me the most because I could be self-sufficient in my learning. Learning is in my own hands, and it would be detrimental to my learning if I just copied the screencast answers. Instead, taking the time to do WODs by myself and then only using screencast as a last resort is great. It means I don’t have to rely on waiting for a TA or Professor to respond when I have a limited window to work on assignments. </p>
    <BR>
